### Probing Activations in gpt2-small

The main notebook (```main.ipynb```) is a walkthrough for using simple linear classifiers to probe activations in gpt2-small using Neel Nanda's ```transformer-lens``` library. The best way to view it is to download a copy and work with it in your IDE, rather than viewing it in github directly, since .ipynb can't be run in github.
